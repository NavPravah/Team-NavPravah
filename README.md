## 1. The Challenge

Indian Railways operates one of the world's most complex rail networks. Coordinating thousands of daily train movements is a massive combinatorial optimization challenge. Current manual and semi-automated traffic control systems are becoming insufficient as traffic volumes rise.

This leads to several limitations:
* **Reactive Decision-Making:** Actions are often taken in response to disruptions, leading to cascading delays.
* **Local Optimization:** A decision that seems optimal for one section can create larger problems downstream.
* **Scalability Issues:** The number of potential conflicts grows exponentially with traffic, overwhelming manual analysis.

Project Raftaar is a decision-support system designed to overcome these challenges by providing intelligent, data-driven recommendations to traffic controllers.

## 2. Our Solution: A 3-Step Hybrid Architecture

Raftaar is an integrated, three-layer solution designed to provide predictive, optimal, and adaptive traffic control.

### Step 1: Machine Learning (ML) for Predictive Delay Analysis
This module acts as the system's predictive front-end.
* **Model:** We use an XGBoost regression model trained on historical data (time of day, weather, route congestion, etc.).
* **Output:** The model predicts the initial delay for each train, giving our optimization engine a more accurate picture of the future. This enables proactive, rather than reactive, scheduling.

### Step 2: Operations Research (OR) for Real-Time Optimization
This is the core of our system. It takes the predicted state from the ML module and finds the best possible conflict-free schedule.
* **Infrastructure Model:** The railway network is modeled as a directed graph, capturing all tracks, junctions, and platforms.
* **Optimization Algorithm:** We use Simulated Annealing, a powerful metaheuristic algorithm ideal for navigating the vast solution space of railway scheduling. It efficiently finds near-optimal solutions by avoiding suboptimal local minima.
* **Objective Function:** The algorithm's goal is to minimize total system-wide delay while maximizing throughput, factoring in train priorities.
* **Conflict Detection:** A sophisticated event-based simulation correctly models both track and node (junction) contention, ensuring all generated schedules are physically possible and safe.

### Step 3: Reinforcement Learning (RL) for Adaptive Improvement
This module serves as a long-term learning layer, allowing the system to self-improve.
* **Function:** The RL agent observes the real-world outcomes of the schedules generated by the OR module and the actions of the human controller.
* **Outcome:** Over time, the agent fine-tunes the parameters within the OR module's objective function. This makes our solution an effective Human-in-the-Loop system that adapts to the unique characteristics of a specific railway section.

## 3. Key Features

* **Comprehensive Delay Prediction:** Accounts for both ML-predicted delays and non-predictable factors (e.g., chain pulling, locomotive issues).
* **Dynamic Headway Management:** Adjusts the minimum safe distance between trains based on real-time conditions like weather.
* **Prioritized Train Scheduling:** The objective function ensures that high-priority trains are given precedence.
* **Track Anomaly Detection & Rerouting:** Identifies non-functional tracks and automatically finds alternative routes.
* **Congestion Mitigation:** Strategically manages platform allocation to prevent bottlenecks.

## 4. System Architecture

The entire OR module is wrapped in a Flask API, making it a ready-to-use backend for the project's dashboard.

A central `/optimize` endpoint receives the current train state in JSON format, runs the optimization, and updates a central data store. A suite of GET endpoints allows the frontend to poll for the latest data for specific dashboard components (e.g., train queue, platform status).

This API powers a real-time Railway Control Center dashboard that visualizes live train movements, predicted conflicts, platform status, and key performance indicators (KPIs).
